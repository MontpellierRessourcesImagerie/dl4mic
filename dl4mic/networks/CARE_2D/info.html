Content aware image restoration (CARE) is a deep-learning method capable of image restoration from corrupted bio-images. The network allows image denoising and resolution improvement in 2D and 3D images, in a supervised training manner. The function of the network is essentially determined by the set of images provided in the training dataset. For instance, if noisy images are provided as input and high signal-to-noise ratio images are provided as targets, the network will perform denoising.

This particular network enables image segmentation of 2D datasets. If you are interested in 3D datasets,
    you should use the 3D CARE instead.
